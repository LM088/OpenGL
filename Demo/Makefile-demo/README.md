# Makefile Demo 

Demo folder to build helloTriangle.o file. 

This serves as a template for how a basic makefile should be written.

The rest of the repo will be organized into src and include folders, which makes the makefile config slightly complicated, plus the include headers in glad.c and main.cpp will have to be modified as well to point the compiler to the right directories.
